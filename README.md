Hi!
My name is Nikita, and I’m a first-year student at BSUIR (Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics), Faculty of Radio Engineering (FRE).
This repository contains my completed laboratory works. It serves both as a personal archive and as a way to track my academic progress.
